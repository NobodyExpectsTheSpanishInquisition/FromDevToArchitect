# Introduction

_"A software architect creates the concepts for software and helps turn those concepts into plans, just like an architect
who designs buildings. But while building architects are not typically concerned with how their ideas are implemented, a
software architectâ€™s roles and responsibilities involve making high-level decisions regarding the tools, coding
standards, or platforms to be used."_
